# Alfred-workflow-word-count
A simple Alfred workflow to return the word count of selected text. You can then simply end the workflow by pressing <Enter> or choose to copy the number of words to the clipboard. If you choose to copy to the clipboard the workflow posts a notification so that you will know it has not died without doing anything.
This workflow works as a Universal Action on selected text and returns the word count of the selected text. Please note that it requires Alfred 5.

**Note**
If you have not previously used `Automation Taks` in any Alfred workflow you may need to doouble click on the `Automation Task` in this workflow and then choose `Update Tasks` at the bottom of the left hand pane to ensure tasks are up to date.
